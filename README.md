simple-mern-store
A basic MERN stack shop application where users can:
Add products
View product listings
Simulate buying
This project is part of my full-stack web development journey. The goal is to build a functional and clean shop app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

ðŸ’» Tech stack:
MongoDB (database)
Express.js (backend framework)
React.js (frontend library)
Node.js (runtime environment)

ðŸš€ Features:
Add new products with basic details
Display product list on the frontend
Simulate a simple purchase flow
Clean REST API structure

ðŸ›  Current status:
This is a work in progress â€” I am actively building and improving the app as I explore more concepts in full-stack development.
